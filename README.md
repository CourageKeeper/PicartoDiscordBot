README

This is version 2.0 of the Picarto/Discord interface bot.
The two primary differences are:
	1. It uses NeDB as an in-memory database to manage the servers, streamers, and their online states.
	2. It interfaces with Picarto's public API, allowing it to be configured by the end users.
	
Description:
	The Picarto We're Live! bot allows a Discord server owner to join the bot to their channel and set it up to notify
	a text channel when a streamer goes live on Picarto.tv.
